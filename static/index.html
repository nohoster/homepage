<h1>Privacy</h1>

<p>No infromation is being stored at my server. All the services listed above are just frontends, meaning the information is stored at the service provider (Twitter and Reddit for example). All the configuration and preference changes you make at these frontends are saved LOCALLY at YOUR computer. They are stored at YOUR browser cookies. You can learn more about this at each of the services git pages.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t store and don&#39;t have enabled any acess logs. Only error logs are enabled for debuggin purposes.</p>
